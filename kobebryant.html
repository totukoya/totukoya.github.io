<center><u><h1>Kobe Bryant</h1></u></center>
<p>Kobe Bryant is one of the most popular and successful basketball players of recent times. His father is a retired professional basketball player of America and his father is probably the inspiration behind his fondness for this game. He started playing from an early age and even represented his school in many matches. He helped his school register a victory after fifty-three years which was a great moment for the school and Bryant both. After completing high school, this player decided to pursue a career in basketball and did not continue further studies. He was one of few players who were inducted into the ‘NBA’ directly from high school. He was made a member of his long-time favourite team ‘Lakers’ and since then this talented player has never looked back. His performance improved with every game and he added a new feather to his crown. He has experienced many upheavals during his career like injuries and allegations, but this sports personality faced every challenge that came his way and emerged successful. He has set several records and even broke many old records. He has apparently, turned into an asset to his team, the ‘Los Angeles Lakers’..</p>
